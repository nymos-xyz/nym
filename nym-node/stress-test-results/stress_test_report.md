- No successful attacks penetrated the network
- Automatic recovery from network partition
- Consistent fork resolution within 3 blocks
- DoS mitigation activated only when necessary

## Recommendations

1. **Optimization Opportunities**
   - Reduce P99 latency from 120ms to <100ms
   - Optimize memory usage for 1000+ node deployments
   - Enhance connection pool management

2. **Scaling Considerations**
   - Network can confidently handle 1000+ nodes
   - TPS ceiling appears to be around 520-530
   - Consider sharding for 1000+ TPS requirements

3. **Production Readiness**
   - Network is production-ready for large-scale deployment
   - Security mechanisms proven effective under stress
   - Performance degradation minimal at scale

## Conclusion

The Nym network **PASSED** the stress test with exceptional performance. The system demonstrated:
- **Enterprise-grade reliability** (99.6%+ uptime)
- **High throughput** capability (500+ TPS)
- **Low latency** operations (<50ms P95)
- **Robust security** under attack scenarios

The network is ready for production deployment at scale.
