# 🚀 Nym Network Bug Bounty Program Launch

**January 10, 2025** - We're excited to announce the official launch of the Nym Network Bug Bounty Program!

## 🎯 Program Highlights

- **Total Reward Pool**: 1,000,000 NYM tokens
- **Maximum Single Reward**: 100,000 NYM
- **Monthly Budget**: 50,000 NYM
- **Scope**: Complete Nym ecosystem including consensus, crypto, network, and privacy components

## 🔍 What We're Looking For

Our bug bounty program focuses on finding security vulnerabilities in:

### High-Priority Areas
- **Consensus Attacks**: Threats to our hybrid PoW/PoS system
- **Cryptographic Vulnerabilities**: Issues with quantum-resistant implementations
- **Privacy Breaches**: Attacks on our zk-STARK and stealth address systems
- **Network Security**: P2P protocol vulnerabilities
- **Smart Contract Bugs**: Issues in our privacy-preserving VM

### Reward Categories
- 🔴 **Critical (up to 100,000 NYM)**: Remote code execution, consensus bypass, fund theft
- 🟠 **High (up to 70,000 NYM)**: Privilege escalation, significant privacy breach
- 🟡 **Medium (up to 40,000 NYM)**: Information disclosure, DoS attacks
- 🟢 **Low (up to 20,000 NYM)**: Minor information leaks, configuration issues
- 🔵 **Info (up to 10,000 NYM)**: Best practice violations, documentation issues

## 🛡️ Why This Matters

Nym is building the future of private, quantum-resistant communication. Your security research helps protect:

- **User Privacy**: Ensuring anonymous transactions and communications
- **Network Security**: Protecting against sophisticated attacks
- **Quantum Resistance**: Validating our post-quantum cryptographic implementations
- **Economic Security**: Securing the hybrid consensus mechanism
