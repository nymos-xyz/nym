# Nymverse Decentralized Compute Platform (NymCompute)
*Privacy-First Decentralized Cloud Computing*

## Overview

Building on the existing Nymverse architecture (QuID + Nym + Axon), this document outlines the design for a decentralized compute platform similar to AO from Arweave, but with enhanced privacy and quantum-resistant security.

## Architecture

### Four-Layer Compute Stack

#### Layer 1: Nym Compute Chain (Blockchain Layer)
Extends the existing Nym blockchain with compute-specific transaction types:

```rust
pub struct ComputeTransaction {
    pub job_id: [u8; 32],
    pub compute_request: ComputeRequest,
    pub resource_requirements: ResourceSpec,
    pub payment: NymToken,
    pub privacy_level: PrivacyLevel,
    pub code_hash: ContentHash,
    pub input_data_hash: ContentHash,
}

pub struct ResourceSpec {
    pub cpu_cores: u32,
    pub memory_gb: u32, 
    pub storage_gb: u32,
    pub network_bandwidth: u32,
    pub gpu_units: Option<u32>,
    pub execution_time_limit: Duration,
    pub geographic_preferences: Vec<Region>,
}

pub enum PrivacyLevel {
    Public,           // Results visible to all
    Private,          // Results only to job submitter
    ZeroKnowledge,    // Only proof of correct execution
    Anonymous,        // Anonymous execution with zk-proofs
}
```

#### Layer 2: QuID-Authenticated Resource Nodes (Identity Layer)
Leverages existing QuID system for node authentication:

```rust
pub struct ComputeNodeRegistration {
    pub node_identity: QuIDIdentity,
    pub capabilities: NodeCapabilities,
    pub stake_amount: NymToken,
    pub reputation_score: f64,
    pub geographic_location: Region,
    pub uptime_commitment: Duration,
}

pub struct NodeCapabilities {
    pub max_cpu_cores: u32,
    pub max_memory_gb: u32,
    pub max_storage_gb: u32,
    pub supported_runtimes: Vec<Runtime>,
    pub privacy_features: PrivacyFeatures,
    pub attestation_support: bool,
}

pub enum Runtime {
    WASM,
    Docker(DockerSpec),
    TEE(TrustedExecutionEnvironment),
    GPU(GPUSpec),
    Quantum(QuantumSpec),
}

pub struct PrivacyFeatures {
    pub secure_enclaves: bool,
    pub memory_encryption: bool,
    pub attestation_hardware: Option<AttestationType>,
    pub zk_proof_generation: bool,
}
```

#### Layer 3: Axon Content & Job Distribution (Content Layer)
Uses Axon's content addressing for code and data distribution:

```rust
pub struct ComputeJob {
    pub job_id: [u8; 32],
    pub submitter: QuIDIdentity,
    pub code_bundle: CodeBundle,
    pub input_data: EncryptedData,
    pub execution_environment: ExecutionEnvironment,
    pub result_specification: ResultSpec,
    pub timeout: Duration,
}

pub struct CodeBundle {
    pub content_hash: ContentHash, // Stored via Axon content system
    pub runtime_type: Runtime,
    pub entry_point: String,
    pub dependencies: Vec<ContentHash>,
    pub resource_limits: ResourceLimits,
}

pub struct ExecutionEnvironment {
    pub privacy_level: PrivacyLevel,
    pub verification_requirements: VerificationSpec,
    pub node_selection_criteria: NodeSelectionCriteria,
}
```

#### Layer 4: Privacy-Preserving Execution (Execution Layer)
Zero-knowledge compute with existing zk-STARK infrastructure:

```rust
pub struct PrivateExecution {
    pub job_id: [u8; 32],
    pub execution_proof: ZkStarkProof,
    pub result_commitment: Commitment,
    pub execution_log_hash: [u8; 32],
    pub resource_usage: ResourceUsage,
}

pub struct ZKComputeProof {
    pub correctness_proof: ZkStarkProof,
    pub input_commitment: Commitment,
    pub output_commitment: Commitment,
    pub execution_trace_proof: ZkStarkProof,
}
```

    }
}
```

```rust
pub struct ExecutionPipeline {
    pub async fn execute_job(
        &self,
        job: ComputeJob,
        selected_nodes: Vec<ComputeNodeId>,
    ) -> Result<ExecutionResult> {
        // 1. Distribute code and data
        // 2. Setup secure execution environment
        // 3. Monitor execution
        // 4. Collect and verify results
        // 5. Generate proofs

    }
}
```
