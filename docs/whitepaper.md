# Nym: Quantum-Resistant Anonymous Block-Lattice Cryptocurrency
## Privacy-First, Scalable, Smart Contract Platform

### Abstract

Nym introduces a revolutionary cryptocurrency architecture that combines the scalability benefits of individual account chains (block-lattice) with comprehensive transaction anonymity through quantum-resistant zero-knowledge proofs. Unlike existing privacy coins that bolt privacy onto traditional blockchain architectures, Nym is designed from the ground up with privacy as the default state, using zk-STARKs to ensure all transactions remain completely anonymous while maintaining the performance characteristics of high-throughput cryptocurrencies like Nano.

The platform features a custom smart contract virtual machine optimized for privacy-preserving computations, enabling decentralized applications that can process sensitive data without compromising user privacy. All cryptographic operations use NIST-standardized post-quantum algorithms, ensuring long-term security against quantum computer attacks. While privacy is the default, users can optionally make specific transactions publicly verifiable for transparency when needed.

Nym employs a novel hybrid Proof-of-Work/Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism with adaptive tail emissions that automatically adjusts inflation based on network health, combined with MimbleWimble-inspired storage optimizations that reduce blockchain bloat by up to 98% while preserving all privacy guarantees.

### 1. Introduction

Current cryptocurrency landscape faces a fundamental trilemma between scalability, privacy, and quantum resistance. Bitcoin and Ethereum provide transparency but lack privacy and quantum resistance. Privacy coins like Monero and Zcash offer anonymity but sacrifice scalability and remain vulnerable to quantum attacks. High-performance cryptocurrencies like Nano achieve impressive throughput but offer no privacy protections.

Nym solves this trilemma by introducing an anonymous block-lattice architecture that:
- Provides complete transaction anonymity by default using quantum-resistant zk-STARKs
- Achieves high throughput through individual account chains and asynchronous processing
- Enables complex smart contracts while preserving privacy
- Uses only quantum-resistant cryptographic primitives throughout the entire stack
- Allows optional public transactions for transparency when explicitly chosen by users
- Implements adaptive economic mechanisms that ensure long-term network sustainability
- Reduces storage requirements through privacy-preserving optimizations

### 3. Privacy Protocol

#### 3.1 Stealth Address System

Nym implements an advanced stealth address protocol for complete recipient anonymity:

***
StealthAddress {
    // Derived for each transaction
    one_time_address: SHAKE256(
        recipient_view_key, 
        sender_random, 
        transaction_index
    )
    
    // Encrypted for recipient
    encrypted_amount: AES-256-GCM(amount, shared_secret)
    encrypted_memo: Option<AES-256-GCM(memo, shared_secret)>
    
    // zk-STARK proof that stealth address is valid
    validity_proof: ZkStarkProof
}

// Recipient's key structure
RecipientKeys {
    view_key: ML-DSA-PrivateKey      // For detecting transactions
    spend_key: ML-DSA-PrivateKey     // For spending received funds
    public_view_key: ML-DSA-PublicKey
    public_spend_key: ML-DSA-PublicKey
}
***

#### 3.2 Zero-Knowledge Transaction Proofs

Each transaction includes comprehensive zk-STARK proofs:

***
AnonymityProof {
    // Proves sender has sufficient balance without revealing amount
    balance_proof: {
        committed_balance: PedersenCommitment
        range_proof: ZkStarkRangeProof  // Proves 0 ≤ amount ≤ balance
        balance_consistency: ZkStarkProof
    }
    
    // Proves signature validity without revealing public key
    signature_proof: {
        signature_commitment: Commitment
        public_key_commitment: Commitment
        signature_validity: ZkStarkProof
    }
    
    // Prevents double-spending without revealing transaction graph
    nullifier_proof: {
        nullifier: SHAKE256(spend_key, transaction_input)
        nullifier_validity: ZkStarkProof
        double_spend_protection: ZkStarkProof
    }
    
    // Proves membership in anonymity set
    membership_proof: {
        merkle_root: SHAKE256
        membership_path: Vec<SHAKE256>
        membership_validity: ZkStarkProof
    }
}
***

#### 3.3 Optional Public Transactions

Users can explicitly choose to make transactions public for transparency:

***
PublicTransactionData {
    revealed_sender: AccountID
    revealed_recipient: AccountID
    revealed_amount: Amount
    public_memo: Option<String>
    
    // Cryptographic proof this revelation is authentic
    revelation_proof: {
        commitment_opening: CommitmentOpening
        consistency_proof: ZkStarkProof
        authorization_signature: ML-DSA-Signature
    }
    
    // Must be explicitly authorized by sender
    public_authorization: {
        public_commitment: "I authorize public revelation of this transaction"
        authorization_timestamp: Uint64
        authorization_signature: ML-DSA-Signature
    }
}

### Conclusion

Nym represents a paradigm shift in cryptocurrency design, prioritizing privacy and quantum resistance without sacrificing performance or functionality. By combining the efficiency of block-lattice architecture with the anonymity of zk-STARKs and the power of privacy-preserving smart contracts, Nym creates a platform suitable for a future where privacy is paramount and quantum computers threaten traditional cryptographic systems.

The platform's design ensures that privacy is the default state rather than an optional feature, while still allowing users to opt into transparency when beneficial. This approach, combined with comprehensive quantum resistance, hybrid consensus security, adaptive economic mechanisms, and MimbleWimble-inspired storage optimizations, positions Nym as the foundation for the next generation of privacy-preserving decentralized applications.

Nym's innovative hybrid economic model with adaptive tail emissions ensures long-term network sustainability while the MimbleWimble-inspired optimizations solve the blockchain bloat problem, making privacy accessible and sustainable for global adoption.
