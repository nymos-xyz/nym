cargo build --bins --release

# Run quick audit
./target/release/audit_runner quick --format json --output results.json

# Run fuzzing test
./target/release/fuzzing_harness crypto --duration 300 --output-dir fuzzing_output
```

### Using Makefile
```bash
# Build everything
make build

# Quick audit
make audit-quick

# Full audit
make audit-full

# Fuzzing
make fuzz-crypto

# Demo
make demo
```

### CI/CD Integration
```bash
# Pre-commit security checks
make pre-commit

# Full security validation
make security-validation
```

## Production Readiness
