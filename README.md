Nym is a privacy-focused cryptocurrency built with quantum-resistant cryptography, featuring stealth addresses, confidential transactions, and QuID-based universal authentication.

## 🔐 Key Features

- **Quantum-Resistant Cryptography**: Built with ML-DSA signatures and SHAKE256 hashing
- **QuID Universal Authentication**: Seamless integration with QuID for secure identity management
- **Complete Privacy**: Stealth addresses and encrypted balances by default
- **Account Chains**: Individual transaction chains for each user
- **Hybrid Consensus**: PoW + PoS for maximum security
- **Storage Optimization**: MimbleWimble-inspired cut-through for scalability

## 🏗️ Architecture

Nym consists of several interconnected crates:

### Core Components

- **`nym-crypto`**: Quantum-resistant cryptographic primitives
  - ML-DSA signatures (placeholder using SHAKE256)
  - zk-STARK proof systems
  - Stealth address generation
  - Homomorphic commitments

- **`nym-core`**: Core data structures and QuID integration
  - Account management with QuID authentication
  - Private and public transaction types
  - Encrypted balance management
  - Blockchain state management

- **`nym-storage`**: Encrypted storage layer
  - Privacy-preserving transaction storage
  - Account chain persistence
  - Compressed and encrypted data

- **`nym-consensus`**: Hybrid PoW/PoS consensus (planned)
- **`nym-network`**: P2P networking layer (planned)
- **`nym-cli`**: Command-line interface (planned)
- **`nym-node`**: Full node implementation (planned)

## 🚀 QuID Integration

Nym leverages QuID for universal authentication:

```rust
// Create QuID authentication
let quid_auth = QuIDAuth::new(master_key, SecurityLevel::Level1);
let identity = quid_auth.create_nym_identity(0)?;

// Generate stealth address for privacy
let stealth_addr = identity.generate_stealth_address()?;

// Create private transaction with QuID signing
let tx = PrivateTransaction::new(
    TransactionType::PrivateTransfer,
    inputs, outputs, balance_proof, fee,
    &identity  // QuID-based authentication
)?;
```

## 🛠️ Development Status

### ✅ Completed (Weeks 1-12)

## 🧪 Testing

```bash
# Test all components
cargo test

# Test specific crate
cargo test -p nym-crypto
cargo test -p nym-core
cargo test -p nym-storage

# Run with output
cargo test -- --nocapture
```

### Current Test Status
- **nym-crypto**: 21/28 tests passing (75%)
- **nym-core**: 12/19 tests passing (63%)
- **nym-storage**: In development

*Note: Some test failures are expected due to placeholder cryptographic implementations. Tests will pass when real ML-DSA and zk-STARK libraries are integrated.*

## 🔧 Building

### Prerequisites

- Rust 1.70+ (stable)
- RocksDB development libraries

### Build Commands

```bash
# Build all crates
cargo build

## 🔒 Security

- **Quantum Resistance**: All cryptography designed to resist quantum attacks
- **Memory Safety**: Built in Rust with automatic memory management
- **Constant-Time Operations**: Timing attack resistance
- **Encrypted Storage**: All data encrypted at rest
- **QuID Integration**: Leverage battle-tested authentication

## 📊 Privacy Features

### Stealth Addresses
- One-time addresses for each transaction
- Unlinkable payments
- QuID-derived key management

### Confidential Transactions
- Encrypted amounts using homomorphic commitments
- Range proofs to prevent inflation
- Balance privacy for all users

### Account Chains
